# Greencart - Smart Eco Shopping ðŸŒ±

Greencart is a mini-project that promotes eco-friendly shopping by helping users identify sustainable products and earn Green Points. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it works entirely in the browser without any backend.

## Features
- Enter a product name to check its **eco-score** (carbon footprint and recyclability)  
- Suggests **eco-friendly alternatives**  
- Users **earn Green Points** for choosing sustainable products  
- Total points are tracked in the browser using **localStorage**  
- Simple, lightweight, and interactive UI with a green-themed design  

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser or VSCode Live Server  
2. Enter the product name  
3. Click **Check Eco-Score** to see the sustainability details and points earned  
4. View **Total Green Points** accumulated  
5. Optionally, click **Reset Green Points** to start over  

## Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

## Notes
- The product database is **easily extensible**; new products can be added in `script.js`  
- Points are tracked locally; refreshing the page retains points thanks to `localStorage`
